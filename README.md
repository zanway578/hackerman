# Hackerman - a take on Spybotics: The Nightfall Incident

## Purpose
I started work on this game to learn Kotlin and hopefully resurrect what was arguably my favorite childhood game.

## Progress
I have implemented a title screen plus world map generation, where the map data is pulled from an XML file. Unfortunately, the actual gameplay loop where you enter levels has yet to be implemented. If there are any interested developers who would like to collaborate, I would be interested.
